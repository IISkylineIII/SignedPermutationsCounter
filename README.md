# SignedPermutationsCounter

# Description
SignedPermutationsCounter is a simple Python implementation to compute the total number of signed permutations for n elements. In a signed permutation, each element can appear as either positive or negative, effectively doubling the number of arrangements per element.

This calculation is useful in combinatorics and computational biology, particularly in problems involving genome rearrangements.

# Features
* Calculates the total number of signed permutations for a given length n.
* Accounts for both element ordering and sign variation.
* Uses iterative multiplication instead of factorial for clarity.

# Function

from math import factorial
```
n = 7
total_permutations = 1
for i in range(n):
    total_permutations *= (2 * (n - i))

print("The number of signed permutations of length 7 is:", total_permutations)
```


# Purpose
* Computes the total number of signed permutations of n elements.

# Parameters
* n (int): Number of elements in the permutation (e.g., 7)

# Returns
* int: Total number of signed permutations (2^n × n!)

# Example
```
n = 7
# Expected result: 2^7 × 7! = 128 × 5040 = 645120
```

# Output

7 is: 645120

# Applications
* Bioinformatics: Modeling chromosomal rearrangements.
* Comparative Genomics: Studying genome mutations via reversals and transpositions.
* Discrete Mathematics: Enumeration of signed permutations (hyperoctahedral group).

# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Standard library (math)
